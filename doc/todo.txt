DB: reserviert
DB: add paladin names and weapons
DB: add tribes table
DB change: building and support reductions in battles

fix attacking_city selector bug
check DB version on startup -> if missing DB or wrong version offer to copy the "empty" default-DB and backup the existing DB -> ask if it should import now
multivillage: only offer targets when in closest village
filter profile buttons (one row per attacking_city)
filter by travel time -> for scout auto-reduce filter so it only shows those that would be reachable in this time with lcav
after import update status bar
restrict number of displayed targets
new filter: loot + spied
set attacker_village_id in scheduled_attacks

make delete work on conquered city
vertical spacing bug
check it works with FF-complete saves
check it works with chrome saves
calculate total en-route res
check that i handle players with multiple villages correctly
rename recreate_tables to delete_and_recreate_database
deliver world data as sql or something so that users can recreate db

divert all output to file
make sure i deduct battle losses (of walls and units)
make sure i parse tribe correctly, make configurable list of dont-attack tribes
store all reports into DB, not just the newest
detect inactive players, filter by that
	confirm with spy save: see if i detected units who are not at home
		militia means player is active
avg % of loot capacity gotten for each target (over the last week)
on 210 it showed loot, even though it was merely spied
check >1k looted res, units etc are also parsed correctly
	let report_parser not commit to DB
my favourite filter settings dont display some reports (the ones with no resources?)
new filter: attack underway
display calculated points
pgsql run to ensure data types
reorder methods alphabetically
on row delete offer to move or delete the report(s)
handle ownership change automatically
tabAdelungen
read maps
list targets i need to spy

DB changer: tool that copies scheduled_attacks from an old DB
inotify or something to auto-import

save current settings on exit (ini file, with defaults from user_settings.py, overridable at CLI)
display db_create_ts, schema_version, created_with_tool_version in db info (if available)
sorting
put db in proper locations
deutsche übersetzung
hide wall level/unit count if they are set to max/equal 0
dont crash on failed import but display error
shrink button that reduces it to 1 row of displayed data
parse remaining battle report data
complete parsing buildings from battle-spy report (4.htm might be "complete") -> cross-check vs points

=bugs=
806.htm
clicking X doesnt cause it to go through regular shutdown

=later alphas=
multiworld: casual5
check sqlite docs if parallel running should work
extra scout button or even tab
filter by minimum points for barb
move files that have been imported to backup folder (same structure as main)
	make recreate_tables move contents of backup folder back to main folder and run import
maybe: 6h min time between attacks if <50% loot capacity
PA only?: kampfsim-button

make sure i disconnect DB on shutdown
support multiple worlds
	check reportparser handles world correctly
	DiaSelectWorlds
	world drop down on left file
	import necessary details from world html files
	support world options that differ from de122

display target player name
restore DB feature
clear expired scheduled attacks
convert user_settings to ini file
testsuite like in fpdb
check if it's permissible to use automated sharing with tribe
take into account hiding_place and storage when calculating res
make it work with complete site saved (ie instead of html-only)
return IDs of imports from parser to display details of success in status bar
make sure it works for incoming spies/attacks, too
add building costs and productions
update checker
daylight saving time?
mypy

=no immediate plans=
enter available units and have it say optimal sending combo
take into account target warehouse
calculate home warehouse requirement for expected raid result and production for user-given time period
other language versions of TW
calculate to send units separated by speed so that returns bunch up
